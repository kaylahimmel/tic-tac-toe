## How to play

- X always goes first
- Click any empty square to place your mark
- The first player to get three in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally — wins
- Squares are labeled by row (A, B, C) and column (1, 2, 3), so the top-left is A1 and the bottom-right is C3
- The move history on the right shows each move in order — click any entry to jump back to that point in the game
- If all squares are filled with no winner, the game ends in a draw — click **Play again** to reset
